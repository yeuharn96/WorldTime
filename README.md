# World Time

This is a mobile application made in Flutter(ver. 2.2.1) & Dart(ver. 2.13.1).

This app fetch time data from [WorldTimeAPI](http://worldtimeapi.org/) and display to user at home screen.

To run the code, a few things would be required to download/install:
1. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows)

I made this project while I am following along the [Flutter Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ) on [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg)'s YouTube channel, feel free to check on it!

Besides, I have implemented some minigames inspired by [Coding Challenges](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH) videos from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) in the app for myself to further familiarize in Flutter app development, such as:
